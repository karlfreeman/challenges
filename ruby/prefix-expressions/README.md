## Prefix expressions

## Description:
You are given a prefix expression. Write a program to evaluate it.

## Input sample:
The first argument will be an input file with one prefix expression per line. e.g.

* + 2 3 4

Your program has to read this and insert it into any data structure you
like. Traverse that data structure and evaluate the prefix expression.
Each token is delimited by a whitespace. You may assume that the only
valid operators appearing in test data are '+','*' and '/' 

## Output sample:
Print to stdout, the output of the prefix expression, one per line. e.g.

20
